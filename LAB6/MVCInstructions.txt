New Project -> WEB PROJECT ASP.NET WEB APPLICATION

Select MVC template.

Add Unit Tests check box.
Name it something. (MVCReview.Tests)

Controller has 'HomeController.cs' It references 'Views -> Home -> About/Contact/Index.html'
	You can run the page and it will host.

Add another 'tab' (view) --- Product/Employees List.

Under 'Views -> Home -> Shared -> _Layout.cshtml', we can see the links to each page. We add the link to the new tab here.

Under the Unit Test section (MVCReview.Tests), open the 'Controllers -> HomeControllerTest.cs'
	Here we have our methods for each page (public void About, etc). Add one for the additional page. 
	If you change one half of the text view, it errors out (the ASSERT.AREEQUAL line). That line and the exact line in the main MVC template need to be the same.

Under the Model folder, add a class (Right-Click -> Add -> Class). Select 'Class' under Visual C#. Name it products.
	Under the class products, add your getters and setters for the page.
		Public int id {get; set;}, etc.

MVC is for web applications that handle dynamic data. Even for small projects. 

You could add another controller under the 'Controllers' folder. (Right click Controllers -> add -> controller).
	If you're not sure what controller we want to use, always select 'MVC 5 Controller - Empty'. Click 'Add'. Give it a name (In our case, we call it ProductsController)
	Make sure you use the variables and names provided in the 'Models -> Products.cs'
	Add 'using MVCReview.Models;' at the top.
	Right-click on the 'ActionResult' and goto 'Add -> View'. Give it the name PRODUCT, the template as LIST, and the model class as PRODUCTS. Check off 'Create as a partial view'. Click add. This creates the 'Products' view in the 'MVCReview' project (View -> Home -> Products).

Add the respective methods/links to: Layout, HomeController in the MVCProject and the HomeControllerTest in the secondary project.

Add a new Unit test to the 'unit test'. Rename it as ProductControllerTest.
	Rename the existing void class there as 'Product' and add lines of code similar to ones found in the 'HomeControllerTest.cs' (same project).
