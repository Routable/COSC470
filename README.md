# Software Engineering
### This course explores the design and implementation of large, multi-module-program systems. Topics include the software life cycle, design tools, features and use of module-oriented programming languages, intermodule communication, and eXtreme programming. Students will require significant out-of-class time to complete this course successfully. This course is to be taken in the final year of the BCIS degree. 


### LAB 1 - Unit Testing
    1. Create a method, which takes Fibonacci Numbers (i.e.,  0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13) array as an argument.
    2. Add 1 to each numbers in Fibonacci series ( result; 1,2,2,3,4,6,9,14) and return this results from the method.
    3. Create a test case method to check based on your input array and output array gives the right result.
    Hint: CollectionAssest.AreEqual( ) function/method to test two arrays.
    
### LAB 2 - Unit Testing Continued
    Implement and run test cases to test following string operations:

    String concatenation 
    String comparison
    String copy
    Empty String
    
### LAB 3 - NUnit Test
    Step 1: Create a class for student details named as 'StudentDetails'.
    Step 2: Create get and set methods in 'StudentDetails' class.
    Step 3: Inside your main class 'Program' define the following methods - 

      public string  Login ( );
      public List<StudentDetails> AllUsers():

    Step 4 : Write NUnit test cases for both of the method Login( ) and AllUsers( ).
    Step 5: Run a loop to check whether any of the list member is empty or not.
    Step 6: Check individual content of list and compare the content as well.
   
 ### LAB 4 - MVC using the .NET Framework
        Marked and completed in class.
        
  ### LAB 5 - MVC and MVC Unit Testing. 
        Creating unit tests for the previously built MVC project.
